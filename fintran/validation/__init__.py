"""Data Validation Framework for fintran.

This module provides comprehensive validation capabilities beyond basic IR schema validation,
including business rule validation, data quality checks, custom validation rules, and detailed
validation reporting.

The validation framework integrates with the existing reader → IR → writer pipeline and
maintains the property-based testing approach established in the core infrastructure.
